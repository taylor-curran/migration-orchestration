CICS Banking Sample Application (CBSA) Migration Plan v1.0
Comprehensive Adaptive Migration Plan: COBOL to Spring Boot Java

Source: taylor-curran/og-cics-cobol-app (29 COBOL programs)
Target: taylor-curran/target-springboot-cics (Spring Boot microservices)
Current Status: 4/29 programs migrated (14% - GETCOMPY, GETSCODE, ABNDPROC, CRDTAGY1)

This plan follows zero-tolerance financial data requirements with explicit
audit/replanning cycles after each parallel group.
