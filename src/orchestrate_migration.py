!ask Analyze migration from taylor-curran/og-cics-cobol-app to taylor-curran/target-springboot-cics

IMPORTANT: Update the structured output immediately and continuously as you analyze.

The structured output has been initialized with template fields. Update them with your analysis:
- Identify exactly 3 parallel, independent tasks for the migration
- Replace the example tasks with specific, actionable migration tasks
- Update the status field as you progress (e.g., "25% complete - analyzing repository structure")
- Update the context field with key findings about the migration

Requirements for the tasks:
- The 3 tasks must be completely independent (can be done in parallel)
- Each task.prompt should be self-contained - assume the agent hasn't seen the repos before
- Include specific file paths, method names, or other details the downstream agent will need
- Each task.definition_of_done should include clear acceptance criteria, often including passing tests

DO NOT FORGET TO UPDATE STRUCTURED OUTPUT BEFORE FINISHING YOUR WORK
